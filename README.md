# Warcraft React Clicker
Let's test how good your memory is. Click the pictures to get points, but don't click the same image more than once. See if you can get all 14!

## What is this game?
This is a demonstration of the **React** framework; a purely front-end application. The game is simple - when clicking on an image, you get a point - but only if you haven't clicked that particular image in that round. You need to recall which images you've clicked on and avoid clicking the same one again.

Get it wrong, and your score will reset. There are only 14 images, so see if you can get that high score.

## How does it work?
This uses some core functionality available with React, spread out between 6 primary components:
   * Bootstrap Navbar (Navbar.js)
   * Score bar, displaying the game title, message, and score (ScoreBar.js)
   * Game field, which holds the images for the game (GameField.js)
   * Character listing (chars.js)
   * Character constructor (Char.js)
   * Finally, the game engine that controls all the logic (Game.js)

## Sounds easy enough. How can I try it?
